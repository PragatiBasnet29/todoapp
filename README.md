# To-Do List Notebook

A simple to-do list application built with Python's Tkinter library, designed to look like a notebook page. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete completed tasks with ease.

## Features

- **Notebook-Styled UI**: The app has a light beige, lined background to resemble a notebook page.
- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks using the `+` button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Delete only tasks that are ticked as complete using the "Delete" button.
- **Task Management**: Checkboxes allow users to mark tasks as completed, changing their appearance to indicate completion.
